This folder contains source code and a gradle project for a
command-line app that reimplements the
[SearchTaskGang](https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/LiveLessons/tree/master/SearchTaskGang)
example from my [Java
Concurrency](http://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/~schmidt/LiveLessons/CPiJava/)
LiveLessons tutorial to show how Java 8 features, such as lambdas,
method references, sequential & parallel streams, and completable
futures, can be applied to search for words in a list of input data
strings. This app also compares and contrasts the performance of
different concurrency models based on Parallel Streams and
CompletableFutures.
